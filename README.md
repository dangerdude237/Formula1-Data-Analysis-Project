# Formula 1 Data Pipeline using Kafka and Azure Cosmos DB

## Project Overview

This project is designed to create a robust data pipeline for Formula 1 race data, utilizing Apache Kafka for data streaming and Azure Cosmos DB for data storage. The main objective is to automate the collection, processing, and storage of Formula 1 race and qualifying data.

### Workflow and Architecture

#### 1. Data Collection
- **Scraping Formula 1 Data**: The project starts by scraping data from the official Formula 1 website. This includes comprehensive details of races and qualifying sessions.
- **Data Transformation**: Once the data is collected, it is transformed into a structured format. Specifically, the raw data is converted into CSV files, making it suitable for streaming and processing.

#### 2. Data Streaming with Kafka
- **Kafka Producer**: The transformed data is then fed into a Kafka Producer. This component is responsible for publishing the CSV data to a Kafka topic.
- **Real-time Data Handling**: Apache Kafka, known for its high throughput and scalability, handles the streaming of race and qualifying data in real time. This ensures efficient and reliable data transmission.

#### 3. Data Consumption and Storage
- **Kafka Consumer**: A Kafka Consumer is implemented to subscribe to the Kafka topic and process the incoming data stream.
- **Storing Data in Azure Cosmos DB**: After processing the data, the Kafka Consumer sends it to Azure Cosmos DB. Azure Cosmos DB serves as the data storage layer, offering high availability, global distribution, and elastic scalability.

## Future Scope
- **Enhancing Data Collection**: Expanding the scope of data scraping to include more detailed statistics and additional information such as weather conditions, pit stop strategies, and telemetry data.
- **Advanced Analytics**: Implementing machine learning models for predictive analytics, such as race outcome predictions or performance analysis.
- **API Integration**: Developing APIs for easier access and integration of the Formula 1 data with other applications or services.
